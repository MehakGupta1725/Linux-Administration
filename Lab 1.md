Experiment 1

Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice files to use during this lab. 
In each set, replace X with the numbers 1 through 6. Create six files with names of the form songX.mp3, snapX.jpg, filmX.avi. 
Create three subdirectories for organizing your files, and name the subdirectories friends, family, and work. 
Use a single command to create all three subdirectories at the same time.
